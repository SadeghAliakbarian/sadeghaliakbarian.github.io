  <p>Short bio:I'm a PhD student at the Australian National University and Australian Centre for Robotic Vision (ACRV). 
    I'm honored to work under supervision of Dr. Lars Petersson (ANU/CSIRO), Dr. Mathieu Salzmann (EPFL), and Dr. Basura Fernando (ACRV/A-STAR) and have pieces of advice from Dr. Stephen Gould (ANU/ACRV).
    My areas of interests are in Machine Learning and AI, with focus on generative models and deep learning approaches for computer vision problems.
